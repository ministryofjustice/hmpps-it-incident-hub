          <li>Convicted - prisoners on remand do not need a POM</li>

          <li>The 'RECALL' Badge is showing on the case record, if this is showing and the case is not a recall then C-NOMIS will have n old recall showing and this needs to be made inactive</li>
          <li>If this is not a recall issue, the case may be within the parole window? If yes; check that the TED or PED has been enetred into C-NOMIS.
            If no, then once this has been entered the service will calculate correctly.</li>
          <li>If the case is post TED/PED; then please use the overide responsibility on the service and send to the community</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">Normally the user can force an update through with a zero change to the sentence if they’ve already entered one.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If someone at site updates the legal case in NOMIS that should force the conviction flag on.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">It’s possible they’ve just marked as sentenced at the point of admission and nobody has updated it since.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To fix this issue, going into the years column on the sentence page on NOMIS, hitting space and save should force it through &amp; update the offenders convicted status.</p>
